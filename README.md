## Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions to build a Docker image. It defines the base image, commands to run, files to copy, and configuration needed to create a container environment.  

## Docker Images

A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone package that includes everything needed to run an application â€” code, libraries, dependencies, and configuration. Images are created from Dockerfiles and are read-only.

### Commands
Download an image from Docker Hub
```bash
docker pull <image>
```
List all local images
```bash
docker images
```
Remove an image
```bash
docker rmi <image>
```
Build an image from a Dockerfile
```bash
docker build -t <name>:<tag>
```
## Containers

A container is a running instance of a Docker image. It is isolated, lightweight, and portable. Containers share the host OS kernel but run independently, making them efficient and fast to start.

### Examples
- [container apache](https://github.com/Elantriss/docker-study/tree/main/web-servers/apache_server)
- [container nginx](https://github.com/Elantriss/docker-study/tree/main/web-servers/nginx_server)
- [container nodejs](https://github.com/Elantriss/docker-study/tree/main/web-servers/server_nodejs)

### Commands
Run an container from an image
```bash
docker run <image>
```
Run an container in detached mode (background)
```bash
docker run -d <image>
```
Run with interactive terminal
```bash
docker run -it <image> sh
```
List running containers
```bash
docker ps
```
List all conatiners (including stopped)
```bash
docker ps -a
```
Start a stopped conatiner
```bash
docker start <container>
```
Restart a conatiner
```bash
docker restart <conatiner>
```
Delete a container
```bash
docker rm <container>
```
Exexute a shell inside the running container
```bash
docker exec -it <container> sh
```
View logs from a container
```bash
docker logs <container>
```
## Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file (docker-compose.yml) to configure services, networks, and volumes, and allows you to start everything with one command.

### Examples
- [compose v1](https://github.com/Elantriss/docker-study/tree/main/compose/compose_example_01)
- [compose v2](https://github.com/Elantriss/docker-study/tree/main/compose/compose_example_02)
- [compose v3](https://github.com/Elantriss/docker-study/tree/main/compose/compose_example_03)
- [compose v4](https://github.com/Elantriss/docker-study/tree/main/compose/compose_example_04)
- [compose v5](https://github.com/Elantriss/docker-study/tree/main/compose/compose_example_05)
- [compose v6](https://github.com/Elantriss/docker-study/tree/main/compose/compose_example_06)

### Commands
Start all services
```bash
docker compose up
```
Start in dechated mode
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
Stop and remove containers, networks, volumes
```bash
docker compose down
```
Build an image from a docker-compose file
```bash
docker compose build
```
## Docker Volumes

Volumes are used to persist data generated by and used in containers. They allow you to store data outside the container's file system, making it easier to manage and share data between containers or across container restarts.

### Commands
List all volumes
```bash
docker volume ls
```
Remove a volume
```bash
dokcer volume rm <volume>
```
List networks
```bash
docker network ls
```
Create a network
```bash
docker network create <name>
```
